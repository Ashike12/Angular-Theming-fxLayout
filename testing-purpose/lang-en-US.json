The single premium paid (any stamp duty paid is not included) earns interest at this rate annually for the term of the contractually agreed insurance. The interest rate applicable to this contract and the resulting guaranteed lump sum death benefit are outlined in the insurance policy. Any partial surrenders reduce the value of the single premium used to calculate the guaranteed lump sum death benefit."

These investments constitute a segregated set of assets of a dedicated insurance fund (hereinafter referred to as “Dedicated Fund”), to which the Insurance Contract is linked and, as such, represent their technical reserves. Such assets, as well as the inherent rights and obligations, are the exclusive property of Swiss Life.",
            "THE_POLICYHOLDER": "The Policyholder hereby confirms that he has been made aware that the Representative shall be solely responsible for managing the assets of the Dedicated Fund. The Policyholder understands that, under Luxembourg law, there is no legal requirement for insurance undertakings to appoint only authorised investment managers for the management of assets that represent the technical reserves of insurance contracts. Under normal circumstances, Swiss Life would only appoint duly authorised investment managers for managing such assets.",
            "SWISS_LIFE": "Swiss Life points out that the Representative is not an authorised investment manager, which the Policyholder hereby acknowledges and accepts. The Policyholder further acknowledges that he may be subject to serious risks and/or legal, fiscal or financial consequences in choosing a non-authorised investment manager.

The Policyholder shall, before taking any decision, particularly with regard to the request for the appointment of a Representative, fulfil all duties of due diligence or seek independent advice for his specific circumstances, including and without limitation, tax and legal advice, as he may deem necessary, in order to fully understand these risks and obtain guidance in relation to such request and the respective implications. The Policyholder shall be solely responsible for obtaining independent legal and tax advice on the practical implications and consequences resulting from the granting of this limited Power of Attorney, taking into account his personal situation, and Swiss Life cannot be held responsible, in any capacity, on this matter.",
            "THE_REPRESENTATIVE": "The Representative hereby accepts that he shall be solely responsible for the management of the assets deposited in the Account, and for all related investment decisions and responsibilities, regardless of their nature (civil, contravening, fiscal, administrative or criminal, as applicable) resulting from such activities.

The Custodian Bank undertakes to refuse to carry out any instructions received from the Representative which are not in conformity with the investment strategy of the Dedicated Fund and/or with the provisions of Circular Letter 15/3. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding this appointment of the Representative as investment manager of the investments made through the Account, Swiss Life shall retain all its rights and powers over the assets deposited in the Account and may, inter alia, monitor or refuse any transactions on that account by the Representative and obtain any information it deems necessary from the Custodian Bank or to carry out any investment at its sole discretion.",

He has also been advised that, in the context of the investment strategy selected by him, a change of assets may be made by the investment manager and this may also entail risks. He is aware that he may achieve an increase in value in the event of a rise in the price of the assets, but equally that the policyholder alone bears the risk of a drop in value in the event of a fall in price. In this connection, Swiss Life points out that a large number of economic factors can influence the performance of the assets invested. At the same time, the policyholder’s decision regarding which investment strategy the assets are to be invested in also affects performance. Higher earnings opportunities are associated with an increased risk of loss, and past performance of assets is no guarantee of their future returns. The policyholder is also aware that foreign exchange investments are subject to exchange rate fluctuations and can influence the value of the life insurance. Therefore Swiss Life cannot be held responsible for unfavourable price developments. In addition, the policyholder hereby releases Swiss Life from any liability that may arise in relation to the purchase, possession or sale of securities (in particular in connection with US securities and the US law on withholding tax), unless Swiss Life has acted with gross negligence or intent."

He has also been advised that, in the context of the investment strategy selected by him, a change of assets may be made by the investment manager and this may also entail risks. He is aware that he may achieve an increase in value in the event of a rise in the price of the assets, but equally that the policyholder alone bears the risk of a drop in value in the event of a fall in price. In this connection, Swiss Life points out that a large number of economic factors can influence the performance of the assets invested. At the same time, the policyholder’s decision regarding which investment strategy the assets are to be invested in also affects performance. Higher earnings opportunities are associated with an increased risk of loss, and past performance of assets is no guarantee of their future returns. The policyholder is also aware that foreign exchange investments are subject to exchange rate fluctuations and can influence the value of the life insurance. Therefore Swiss Life cannot be held responsible for unfavourable price developments. In addition, the policyholder hereby releases Swiss Life from any liability that may arise in relation to the purchase, possession or sale of securities (in particular in connection with US securities and the US law on withholding tax), unless Swiss Life has acted with gross negligence or intent."
